Welcome to TuneBacker! My app is live at https://www.tunebacker.cc/
======================================================================

TuneBacker is an app I designed to provide a way for spotify users to keep their playlists secure with weekly backups and ability to restore playlists between accounts. My app also provides a way to download a playlist as a .csv file, which can be uploaded to any spotify account. This also provides an easy way for users to transfer playlists between accounts. 

***My Tech Stack***
-Frontend: React
-Backend: Node.js and Express 
-Database: Supabase

NOTE: As of March 2025, Spotify only approves legal entities with a minimum of 25,000 users to use their OAuth publicly. Because of this, my app is still in development mode. Authentication through Spotify
is only available for Spotify accounts I specifically whitelist (up to 25 users) through Spotify's developer dashboard. Because of this, my app is used by me and my close family / friends, but is not yet available for public use. 

***Important:***
To test my app, I have created a whitelisted spotify account which you can use.

You can create an account through TuneBacker, and link it to the Spotify account with these credentials.
